    Overengineering for the win.

---

Recently I made a huge leap forward: published one of my side projects: [The Blue Trail Parts](https://kektura-szakaszok.lencse.io/). The main purpose of the app is generating GPS data of hiking paths. Well, it's not 100% finished, but I had the confidence to post a link to a related Facebook group. In this post I'll cover:

- What this app does
- Some technical details
- A description of the build process (which I'm pretty sure looks like a bit overengineered at the first glance)
- Some possible future improvements
- What I learned from this

## The problem this app solves

To understand why I grabbed a keyboard and started the development, we need to know about the domain.

### The National Blue Trail

The National Blue Trail (in Hungarian: *Országos Kéktúra*) is an 1160 km long hiking trail across Hungary. There are checkpoints with stamps on the way and if you gather all the ~230 stamps in your booklet, you'll receive a certificate and an enamel pin. I've been walking the Blue Trail for two years and completed half of it.
