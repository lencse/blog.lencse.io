I'm Levente Löki from Budapest, Hungary.

I'm a self taught full stack web developer, with more than 10 years of programming experience.
I have experience across the full lifecycle of web apps, from meeting with clients to scope
requirements, through to database design, both frontend and backend web development, managing
server configuration and deployment, and long term code maintenance.

This blog reflects my opinion and my actual knowledge. Feel free to message me at
