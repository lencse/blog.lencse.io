    Introducing a pet project
---

I'm working on a pet project called *Hiking Trails*.

## The first prototype — National Blue Trail parts

It started as a small web app for generating tracks in `.KML` format for the [National Blue Trail](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Blue_Trail) a famous hiking trail in Hungary.
The first prototype currently available at [https://kektura-szakaszok.lencse.io/](https://kektura-szakaszok.lencse.io/), and I'm actively using it for hiking in the last few months. Unfortunately it's only in Hungarian.

## Improving with new features

Recently I received good feedback from friends, colleagues and fellow hikers, and an idea struck to me that the app can be developed into a hiking recommendation and track planner site for the larger and smaller hiking trails everywhere in Hungary.

Not only it's a good project that I can work in the next few months — It's a great opportunity to try out new methods. This will be the first pet project that I'm not developing alone in my room (and probably abandon it when it's 50%-80% finished), I try to facilitate a *team* of my friends and hiking partners, to came up with good ideas.

I'll also try to post about the development in this blog.
